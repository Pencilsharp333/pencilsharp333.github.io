  <h1>Tomori Takamatsu</h1>
  <body>
    <p><a href="https://anilist.co/character/302095/Tomori-Takamatsu">Tomori Takamatsu</a> is a first-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the vocalist and lyricist of MyGO!!!!!.

      Tomori is a kind but sensitive girl who has an awkward personality. She has a tendency to stutter while talking and not make eye contact. She also tends to blame herself for the conflicts that happen around her, even if they weren't caused by her.
      
      She is infamously known as "Haneoka's Weirdo Girl" due to her peculiar personality. She likes collecting all sorts of things, such as band-aids <strong>(especially ones with animals such as pandas or penguins on them)</strong>, slippery things, just-the-right-size things, and even rocks and fallen leaves that she picks up from the ground. She also likes pill bugs and has been shown often drawing them in her notebooks.
